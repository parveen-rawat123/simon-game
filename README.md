simon game 
The Simon game is a classic electronic memory game that tests a player's ability to remember and repeat sequences of lights and sounds. It typically consists of four colored buttons—often green, red, yellow, and blue—that light up and produce tones in a specific sequence. The game starts with a simple sequence and becomes progressively more challenging as the player successfully repeats the patterns.
